Early, Absentee, and Questioned votes are only reported at the State House district level (since Alaska has portions of the state with no lower level of government, HDs serve a similar purpose as counties do in other states for the purpose of reporting votes). These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the Election Day vote was split among precincts within an HD.

Election results from Florida Division of Elections (http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/elections-data/precinct-level-election-results/)

Precinct shapefile from many sources.

The starting point was the Orlando Sentinel's precinct map for the 2016 presidential primary (http://interactive.orlandosentinel.com/elections/2016/presidential-primary/results/dem.html).

Hillsborough, Lake, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, and Pinellas Counties were updated directly with shapefiles downloaded from county Supervisor of Elections websites.

Brevard, Marion, and Putnam Counties were updated with KML files from the respective county Supervisor of Elections websites, from their election result map pages.

Columbia, DeSoto, Leon, Polk, and Osceola Counties updates received from Supervisor of Elections websites through personal contact.

Highlands, Santa Rosa, Sarasota, and Volusia Counties had some precinct mergers, which were determined based on visual inspection of PDF precinct maps from the county websites.

Charlotte, Hendry, Holmes, Jackson, Jefferson, Levy, Madison, and Walton Counties are from VTDs released by the Census Bureau's Redistricting Data Program.

Hernando 99, Collier 450, and Palm Beach 8001/8002 are UOCAVA precincts with no real geography and votes were not redistributed.

Precinct names were adjusted to align with the formatting used in the voter registration file (e.g., some precincts have leading spaces).

Precinct shapefile from the Georgia General Assembly Reapportionment Office (http://www.legis.ga.gov/Joint/reapportionment/en-US/default.aspx)

The following precincts were split by congressional district to match the 2016 election results: Avondale High, Glennwood, Wadsworth in Dekalb County; Cates D in Gwinnett County.

Cloudland and Teloga precincts in Chattooga County were split along the ridgeline that marks the boundary between them with the USGS Topographic Contour shapefile.

Three of the four VTDs in Chattahoochee County are comprised of Fort Benning. However, the county only has one polling location for all voters, including residents of Fort Benning that vote within the county. The four Chattahoochee County VTDs have therefore been merged in the shapefile.

Precinct shapefile from IA Secretary of State: https://sos.iowa.gov/shapefiles/

The Iowa Democratic Party did not report individual vote tallies for the 2016 Iowa caucuses. The caucus results are State Delegate Equivalents that represent the number of state convention delegates that the candidates received based on the caucus results. The SDE figures are multiplied by 100 following the standard practice of the Associated Press since precinct-level SDE figures are provided as very small fractions in the actual caucus reports.

The precinct results do not include the state delegates awarded via satellite locations for participants with hardship exceptions or via tele-caucus for voters abroad. The satellite locations awarded 2 state delegates to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders. The tele-caucus awarded 1 state delegate to Hillary Clinton and 1 state delegate to Bernie Sanders.

The following precincts were merged to match the 2016 caucus results:

Appanoose: Udell/Union
Black Hawk: Cedar Falls W2P2/Cedar Falls Twp

Election results by township from Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions (https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/elec/results/index.html)
Election results by ward from municipal reports for Auburn, Augusta, Belfast, Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell, Lewiston, Portland, Saco, Sanford, South Portland, Westbrook.

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. Voting District shapefiles were available for Androscoggin, Cumberland, Kennebec, Sagadahoc, Waldo, York. County Subdivision shapefiles were used instead for Aroostook, Franklin, Hancock, Knox, Lincoln, Oxford, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Washington.

VTDs were merged for Bath, Brunswick, Waterville as statewide votes are not reported by ward. VTDs for Biddeford, Ellsworth, Gorham, Harpswell were sourced from township ward maps.

Absentee votes were reported at the township level for Auburn, Lewiston, Gorham, Harpswell, Portland, Westbrook, Augusta, Belfast, Sanford, South Portland. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the township vote for each candidate. Military and overseas ballots (UOCAVA) were reported at the state level. These were distributed to precincts based on the precinct's share of the statewide vote for each candidate.

For Biddeford, Ellsworth, Lewiston, Portland, Sanford, South Portland write-in votes reported at the township level were apportioned to precincts in the same shares that the total vote was split among precincts within the township.

The state reported 987 votes from Portland for Jill Stein (G). The precinct-level votes in the Portland city report add up to 995 total votes for Stein.

Maine includes more than 400 unorganized townships and islands that do not lie within municipal bounds. While some are designated separately, the U.S. Census Bureau combines most of these into larger unorganized territories within each county. Voters in unorganized townships are assigned to nearby incorporated townships. In some cases these votes are reported separately while in others they are combined into the total vote reported from the central voting location. The shapefile has been modified accordingly with boundaries from the Town Boundaries shapefile provided by the Maine Office of GIS. For unorganized territories that are unpopulated or otherwise do not appear to have any registered voters the Census boundaries have been retained unaltered.

Precinct shapefile from the Michigan Department of State (https://gis-michigan.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/8ce0f3ce3ff74109ac02a26d34a0f4fc_1)

Michigan has cities split across counties. Two are relevant to their reported election results versus the precinct map (which did not make the split), Fenton and Richmond. Those precincts were merged to reflect the precinct map.

Most counties had "statistical adjustments" that were at the county level, rather than the precinct level. Only two were for party candidates (Huron and Kalkaka), and in those cases, two or fewer votes. The remaining cases were related to "other" votes. Due to the scattered nature of "other" votes, these votes are apportioned to precincts by the split of total votes of precincts within the county.

Detroit allows for absentee votes to be reported by Absentee Voter Counting Boards, which generally contain multiple precincts. These votes are apportioned to precincts by candidate in the same shares that the non-AVCB vote was split among precincts within a county. The linkage between election precinct and AVCB was provided by OpenElections via Derek Willis. Precinct 176 was listed as split between AVCB 37 and AVCB 158, the only precinct in the city that was listed as split. AVCB 158 has no other precinct assigned to it, so all votes went to precinct 176. However, this was a very low number of votes relative to the other AVCBs, so for ease of calculation, 176 was treated as a normal member of AVCB 37 in the disaggregation calculation described above.

Some counties reported one or more classes of votes at the county level. These were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote.

Write-in votes were inconsistently provided by the counties, so they were excluded. Unofficial precinct results from NE Secretary of State used as a cross-reference in places.

Election results from Nevada Secretary of State (https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information/precinct-level-results)

Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release. The following counties used shapefiles sourced from the respective county governments instead: Clark, Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, Lincoln, Lyon, Washoe.

County borders in all county-sourced shapefiles were aligned to the U.S Census Bureau's boundaries. Minor adjustments were made in the Precinct 1/3 boundary of Eureka County and in the Precinct 6/5 boundary of Pershing County to match county GIS maps. Substantial revisions were made in the Fallon area of Churchill County and in the Tonopah area of Nye County to match county PDF maps.

Countywide-reported votes for Carson City, Churchill, Clark, Douglas, Elko, Humboldt, Lyon, Nye, Pershing, Washoe, and White Pine were distributed by candidate based on the precinct-level reported vote. Clark County had congressional district-reported votes that were distributed accordingly.

The state election results by precinct do not include precinct votes by candidate for precincts with less than 10 total votes cast. For Douglas and Washoe, these were transferred from the county precinct reports. For Churchill, Elko, Esmeralda, Humboldt, Lyon, Mineral, Nye, Pershing, Storey, and White Pine these were inferred from the countywide totals. Clark County was also inferred from countywide totals, but using additional party registration information as of Nov 5, 2016 with slight adjustments to match total ballots cast per precinct.

Oregon
------
Election results from the Oregon Secretary of State's office via OpenElections (https://github.com/openelections/openelections-data-or/). Results from Polk, Tillamook, Wallowa, and Wasco counties were corrected with the respective county reports.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were obtained from the following counties: Benton, Columbia, Coos, Crook, Curry, Deschutes, Douglas, Harney, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath, Lane, Linn, Malheur, Morrow, Multnomah, Polk, Sherman, Tillamook, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa, Wasco, Washington, Yamhill.

Precinct shapefiles for the 2016 election were provided by the Oregon Secretary of State's office for the following counties: Clatsop, Hood River, Jefferson, Marion. The Marion County shapefile included numerous gaps that were assigned based on the Precinct Split Summary report from the county clerk's office. Precincts along the Salem/Kaiser border were revised with the corrected municipal boundaries from the Marion County 2019 precinct shapefile.

The 2016 precinct shapefile for Clackamas County was provided by the Metro Regional Government Data Resource Center.

Precinct boundaries for Grant County and Wheeler County are defined by school district boundaries. Precinct shapefiles were produced to match PDF maps provided by the respective counties using the 2016 Oregon Education Boundaries shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library.

Precinct shapefiles for the following counties were produced based on PDF maps provided by the respective counties: Baker, Gilliam, Lake, Lincoln. Boundaries defined by the PLSS grid were produced with the Oregon Public Land Survey Quarter-Quarter Reference Grid shapefile obtained from the Oregon spatial Data Library. Municipal boundaries were produced from the Oregon Department of Transportion 2016 City Limits shapefile obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. Street boundaries are produced from the U.S. Census Bureau's census block shapefiles.

PDF maps obtained from Lake County are approximate precinct boundaries drawn on the PLSS grid for county precincts and on the street map for Lakeview city precincts. These boundaries were adjusted to match address range assignments in the Lake County Address Library Report which serves as the legal definition of the precincts according to the Lake County Clerk. Precinct divisions for roads that cross multiple rural precincts are generally defined by zip codes. Address ranges were further identified based on the Lake County tax lot parcel viewer.

Rural precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Coos County and Union County were revised to match the updated PLSS cadastral grid in the Oregon GIS Framework obtained from the Oregon Spatial Data Library. 

Municipal precinct boundaries in the shapefiles provided by Tillamook County and Umatilla County were revised to reverse annexations that were not yet in effect for the November 2016 general election. 

The boundaries of precincts 14, 37, 45, 49 in the Deschutes County shapefile were revised to match legislative district assignments.

Precinct numbers in the Columbia County, Josephine County, and Wallowa County shapefiles were corrected to match the Oregon Secretary of State voter file.

South Dakota
------------
Election Results from South Dakota Secretary of State (https://sdsos.gov/elections-voting/election-resources/election-history/2016_Election_History.aspx)
Precinct shapefiles primarily from the U.S. Census Bureau's 2020 Redistricting Data Program Phase 2 release, with the exceptions of Potter County and Yankton County from the 2010 Census VTD release.

Brookings, Brown, Hughes, Hyde, Potter, Sully, and Yankton use countywide vote centers rather than polling locations by precinct. South Dakota counties with vote centers do not record votes by precinct. For these counties, votes were apportioned to precincts based on their share of the countywide number of ballots cast by voters registered with the party of the respective candidates. When this method was tested with counties that report votes by precinct the great majority of precincts were within 4% of the actual candidate vote shares. However, a scattering of precincts deviated by as much as 12% from the actual vote shares. These precincts tend to be in either city centers or outlying areas, which reflects the fact that registered Democrats in rural precincts are more likely to vote for Republican candidates than registered Democrats in urban precincts.

Lawrence County reported absentee votes countywide. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on their share of the precinct-level reported vote.

The certified precinct report from Minnehaha County adds up to about 18 more votes per office than the countywide totals recorded in the official state canvass. This was evidently an oversight in which the preliminary vote count from Minnehaha County was not updated before the final state canvass.

The following modifications were made in the shapefiles to recreate the 2016 precinct boundaries.

Beadle: Replace 5 commissioner districts with 10 precincts
